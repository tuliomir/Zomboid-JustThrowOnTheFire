# Project Zomboid - Just Throw It On The Fire!
A mod for [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/).

Allows the player to easily add fuel to a campfire by:
- Adding all the fuel items to the Campfire container 
- Converting all of it into fuel with a single click

This will add more use for the dozens of twigs, ripped sheets and paper found on your journeys!

# Bugs and Suggestions
I'm still learning about Zomboid modding. Please leave any bugs or suggestions in the Issues tab.
